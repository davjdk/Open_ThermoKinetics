# Log Aggregator Module - Stage 1 Implementation

## Overview
This is the Stage 1 implementation of the log aggregation system for solid-state-kinetics. It provides basic real-time log aggregation capabilities with pattern detection and buffering.

## Features Implemented
- **AggregationConfig**: Basic configuration management
- **BufferManager**: Memory buffering with time and size-based flushing
- **PatternDetector**: Basic pattern detection for similar log messages
- **AggregationEngine**: Core aggregation logic
- **AggregatingHandler**: Integration with Python logging system

## Integration
The module integrates with the existing LoggerManager through optional parameters:
```python
LoggerManager.configure_logging(
    enable_aggregation=True,
    aggregation_config={"buffer_size": 50, "flush_interval": 3.0}
)
```

## Testing
Run tests with:
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/test_log_aggregator/ -v
```

## Stage 1 Limitations
- No advanced pattern types
- No error expansion engine
- No tabular formatting
- Basic configuration only

## Next Stages
- Stage 2: Enhanced pattern detection
- Stage 3: Tabular formatter
- Stage 4: Error expansion engine
- Stage 5: Full integration
